### About me 🖥️
I’m a final year student of Information System major, I'm so eager to join and contribute for a professional working environment. I’m looking forward to a fresher position as a Backend Developer, where I can apply and enhance my web development skills and gain practical experience in developing and delivering high-quality, scalable, and secure web applications :man_technologist:


For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating webpages with Spring Boot.
- 😀 I like to code, watch youtube's video, and play Clash of Clans in my free time.
- 💬 Ask me about anything but of course I can't answer all of them.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!". It's "Hi World" 🤐.
